<h3>Heirloom Computing TPC-C Benchmark</h3>
<p>
This is an Heirloom Computing, Inc. Elastic COBOL implementation 
of the TPC-C benchmark running as a CICS application under the
Elastic Transaction Platform deployed to the
Heirloom Platform-as-a-Service (HPaaS) in cloud environments.
Together with the <i>TPC-C Driver</i> application, it can simulate
an active customer and supplier parts warehouse scalable to arbitrary
sizes based on the number of ETP instances are handling the thousands
of user sessions, thus demonstrating the scale-out nature of ETP and
the cloud-based databases that back it.</p>
